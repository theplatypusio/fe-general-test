The goal is to create a profile viewer in which you can easily browse through profiles showing information and a picture.

*Key Features:*

* The user should be able to use drag or swipe to browse through cards.
* Use the Random user API to fetch the data and images you need. Api is here: https://randomuser.me/api/
* The solution must be written in JavaScript or TypeScript using React.

## Evaluation
The main goal is to evaluate your ability to solve problems efficiently and get an idea of how you solve a problem.

Important points:

* Keep it simple. The code should be as simple as possible while solving the problem.
* The end result should resemble the design at www.platypus.io. It does not need to be perfect.
* The viewer should have good performance
* We will use your solution as the basis for the technical interview, so be prepared for questions about your design and implementation decisions.

Use Create react app, Gatsby, Next.js or what ever you like, and no need to worry about cross browser compatability. If it works on one of the major browsers we are happy.

## Delivery
Create public git repo (github, bitbucket, gitlab your choice) and send the link to louise@platypus.io. Make sure to include a README.md with instruction on how to build and run your app.
